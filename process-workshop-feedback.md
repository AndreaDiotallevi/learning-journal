# Process Workshop Feedback

[Ten minutes walk](#tuesday-3rd-december-2019---ten-minutes-walk)

## Tuesday 3rd December 2019 - Ten Minutes Walk

  - Create a ```README``` with an input / output table - start with at least 5 rows
  
    INPUT    | OUTPUT
    -------- | ------
    []       | false
    [5n, 5s] | true
    [6n, 4s] | false
    [6n, 6s] | false
    [4n, 4s] | false
    
  - More test cases - think them as in groups, like "North - South", "West - East" and "North - South - West - East"
  
  - Split screen showing code and tests to improve readability both for you and the reviewer
  
  - Variable naming:
   
    - Do not call a variable ```array``` - it can be called for example ```path```
    
    - Do not call a class ```App``` - it can be called for example ```TenMinutesWalk```
    
  - Use ```irb``` only if helpful - for example when I want to see how two different classes interact with each other
  
  - Take the chance to refactor the code after passing the tests
