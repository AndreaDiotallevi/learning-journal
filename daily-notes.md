#### Makers daily notes

## Day 1 - Monday the 11th of November 2019

- Nice first day!
- Really liked how logically Alice explained the core principles for learning software development, while picking up comments from us. I found it very organic.
- Alice suggested to book more than 4 reviews, since not everybody are going to need 4. The advice is to start from week 6, but, if confident, even after week 2.
- Will try to write down my learning progress following the "goal" -> "do / practice" -> "reflect" structure. The reflecting part also includes "can I explain it to someone else?", which leads to validation.
- Enjoyed Dana's energy and I am looking forward to the yoga sessions tomorrow. My spirit animal is eagle, to describe a solitary soul who likes movement.
