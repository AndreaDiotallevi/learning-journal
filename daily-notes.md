# Makers daily notes

### Day 1 - Monday 11th November 2019

- Nice first day! Met my cohort-mates and had the opportunity to chat in small groups, getting to know each other. Also went for lunch with a few of them to Spitalfields Market and was fun.
- Really enjoyed how logically Alice elaborated our motivations to become software developers, while integrating our comments. It was very organic.
- Found very interesting the pyramid "concretes" -> "concept" -> "process" -> "behaviour", from bottom to top. The course will focus on the top 2, while touching on the bottom two, which are easier to be learnt on your own.
- Alice suggested to book more than 4 reviews throughout the entire course, since not everybody is going to need 4. The advice is to start from week 6, but, if confident, even after week 2.
- Will try to write down my learning progress following the "goal" -> "do / practice" -> "reflect" structure. The "reflect" part also includes "can I explain it to someone else?", which leads to validation.
- Enjoyed Dana's energy and I am looking forward to the yoga session tomorrow. My spirit animal is "eagle", to describe a sometimes solitary soul who likes movement.
