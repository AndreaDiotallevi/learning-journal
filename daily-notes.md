# Makers daily notes

### Day 1 - Monday 11th November 2019

- Nice first day! Met my cohort-mates and had the opportunity to chat in small groups, getting to know each other. Also went for lunch with a few of them to Spitalfields Market and was fun.
- Really enjoyed how logically Alice elaborated our motivations to become software developers, while integrating our comments. It was very organic.
- Found very interesting the pyramid "concretes" -> "concept" -> "process" -> "behaviour", from bottom to top. The course will focus on the top 2, while touching on the bottom two, which are easier to be learnt on your own.
- Alice suggested to book more than 4 reviews throughout the entire course, since not everybody is going to need 4. The advice is to start from week 6, but, if confident, even after week 2.
- Will try to write down my learning progress following the "goal" -> "do / practice" -> "reflect" structure. The "reflect" part also includes "can I explain it to someone else?", which leads to validation.
- Enjoyed Dana's energy and I am looking forward to the yoga session tomorrow. My spirit animal is "eagle", to describe a sometimes solitary soul who likes movement.

### Day 2 - Tuesday 12th November 2019

- Week 1 goals:
  - TTD a simple program using objects and methods.
  - Pair using the driver-navigator style.
  - Follow an effective debugging process.
  - Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP.
- Discussed about how to validate goals at the end of week 1:
  - Getting feedback from the pairing partner and coaches, screen recording and commit history.
  - Taking breaks, being mindful about whose time to drive, writing down an explaination or blog post about how to pair well.
  - Create a diagram of the process of debugging to describe the concepts to someone else.
- Really enjoyed the debugging workshop, and got the systematic approach for understanding what the problem is and how to fix it:
  - Tighten the loop: read carefully error messages, with the bug being in the line of code closest to the named error.
  - Get visibility: use `p` to inspect the code, but never put it at the end of a method as it might change its behaviour.
- Type of errors: SyntaxError and RuntimeError (NameError, ArgumentError etc.).
- Paired with Harry. The most challenging thing was being able to talk while getting my head around the current task.
- The challenge for the week was "Boris-bikes" and the learning objectives covered today were:
  - Transform an User Story (short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system) into a Domain Model (an abstraction, model of an area of interest, domain).
  - Define a Feature Test: the process of making changes in software system to add one or more new features or to make modifications in the already existing features.
  - Define a stack trace: a report of the active stack frames at a certain point in time during the execution of a program.
  - Use `irb` to run a Feature Test: `dock_station = DockStation.new` before creating the DockStation class.
  - Explain how to use a stack trace to debug errors, debug an error using a stack trace.
  - Define RSpec as a testing framework, create a spec file, describe an object using a specification.
  - Set up a Unit Test, pass a Unit test, move between Feature and Unit Test.
- Yoga was amazing. It was the first time in my life I have ever done a yoga session and I really loved it. Will be there on Thursday as well!

### Day 3 - Wednesday 13th November 2019

- Paired with Jade and it was so much fun! At the end of the session we had a great feedback chat and highlighted the following:
 - Well respected driver and navigator roles, letting the driver think and find the right solution, with the navigator supervising and googling questions.
 - Balanced interaction opposed to one sided.
 - Both of us explained a concept to the other person (the attr_accessor to Jane and the Feature Test objective to me), and we both understood it well.
 - Relaxed during the entire session since the beginning, making a lot of fun jokes.
 - Being very motivated and assertive throughout the process with a good team spirit.
 - Celebrated the failures and successes with always a smile in our faces.
 - Let the other person try out things without imposing ourselves.
 - Sometimes anticipating the thought or the pairing partner helping to smooth the process.
 - Not getting mad at each at the end, regardless the consistent error messages on the screen.
 - Probably we should have taken more breaks, but we both enjoyed the experience and were happy to continue coding.
