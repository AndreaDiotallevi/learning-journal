# My learning portfolio whilst at Makers Academy

This repository is a detailed learning journal of my daily progress whilst at Makers Academy, a 12-week software development bootcamp. For each week, I have been writing down what to aim for (**goals**), insights into my personal progress (**self-assessment**), feedback from the coaches and course-mates, and real projects.

[Week 1](#week-1) | [Week 2](#week-2) | [Week 3](#week-3) | [Week 4](#week-4) | [Week 5](#week-5) | [Week 6](#week-6) | [Week 7](#week-7) | [Week 8](#week-8) | [Week 9](#week-9) | [Week 10](#week-10) | [Week 11](#week-11) | [Week 12](#week-12)

## Week 1

Learning Objectives | Self-assessment | Links / Evidence
------------------- | --------------- | ----------------
Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods | Good understanding of the TTD process. Able to apply test driven development to guide the code development. Focus on traslating simple specifications into classes and methods | [airport challenge](https://github.com/AndreaDiotallevi/airport_challenge)
Pair using the driver-navigator style | Happy about my communication and working process skills. Good attention on respecting the driver and navigator roles  | [pair-programming sessions](https://github.com/AndreaDiotallevi/makers-portfolio/blob/master/pair-programming-reflections.md)
Follow an effective debugging process | Good improvements over the week. From not paying too much attention to the stack trace, to taking time to carefully analyse each line, without guessing where the bug may come from | [process workshops](https://github.com/AndreaDiotallevi/makers-portfolio/blob/master/process-workshop-feedback.md)
Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP | Good grasp of OOP concepts. Need to refine practical applications on more complex projects | [airport challenge](https://github.com/AndreaDiotallevi/airport_challenge)

## Week 2

Learning Objectives | Self-assessment | Links / Evidence
------------------- | --------------- | ----------------
Use all of week 1's skills | Confident in having achieved the first week goals. Some additional work to be done on debugging and SRP on more complex projects | [takeaway challenge](https://github.com/AndreaDiotallevi/takeaway-challenge)
Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage | The hardest challenge of the week. Happy about my improvements. Still need more practice on the best process for extracting a class and its methods and tests
Unit test classes in isolation using mocking | A new concept I think I have grasped well | [takeaway challenge](https://github.com/AndreaDiotallevi/takeaway-challenge)
Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change) | Happy about my approach of solving problems, aimed at finding the most efficient and maintainable solution
Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback | Learnt to comment another person's code on GitHub, making sure to give a constructive and kind feedback

## Week 3

Learning Objectives | Self-assessment | Links / Evidence
------------------- | --------------- | ----------------
Build a simple web app | Learnt RESTful routes and basic concepts of a MVC app | [rock paper scissors challenge](https://github.com/AndreaDiotallevi/rps-challenge)
Follow an effective debugging process for web applications | Debugging web applications have been more challenging than debugging back end code, as you also have to check that the application actually does what it is supposed to do in the browser
Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS) | Studied the most common HTTP requests and their responses. Consolidated the front end code structure of HTML and CSS
Explain the MVC pattern | Good understanding of the separation of concerns between the model, view and controller. Need more study on RESTful APIs.

## Week 4

Learning Objectives | Self-assessment | Links / Evidence
------------------- | --------------- | ----------------
Build a simple web app with a database | Learnt to use the PG gem and PostgreSQL server to establish a connection between the controller and the database | [chitter challenge](https://github.com/AndreaDiotallevi/chitter-challenge)
Follow an effective debugging process for database applications | Good understanding on how to debug an app with a database
Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships) | Learnt how to query a database with the SQL language, how to create tables and edit them

## Week 5

Learning Objectives | Self-assessment | Links / Evidence
------------------- | --------------- | ----------------
Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript | Happy about the transition between Ruby and Javascript. The Jasmine testing framework is very similar to Rspec.
Follow an effective process for learning a new language | I understand the prototyping in Javascript in relation to the Ruby classes. I might need a bit more practice with Javascript to reach the same level of confidence I now have with Ruby
