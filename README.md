# My learning portfolio whilst at Makers Academy

This repository is a detailed learning journal of my daily progress whilst at Makers Academy, a 12-week software development bootcamp. For each week, I have been writing down what to aim for (goals), how to get there (plan), insights into my personal progress (self-assessment), feedback from the coaches and from the course-mates and actual projects.
