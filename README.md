# My learning portfolio whilst at Makers Academy

This repository is a detailed learning journal of my daily progress whilst at Makers Academy, a 12-week software development bootcamp. For each week, I have been writing down what to aim for (**goals**), how to get there (**plan**), insights into my personal progress (**self-assessment**), feedback from the coaches and course-mates, and real projects.
