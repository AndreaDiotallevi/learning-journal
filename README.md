# My learning portfolio whilst at Makers Academy

This repository is a detailed learning journal of my daily progress whilst at Makers Academy, a 12-week software development bootcamp. For each week, I have been writing down what to aim for (goals), how to get there (plan), insights into my personal progress (self-assessment), feedback from the coaches and course-mates, and real projects.

## Week 1

### Goals

- Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods;
- Pair using the driver-navigator style;
- Follow an effective debugging process;
- Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP.
