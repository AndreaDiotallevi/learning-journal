By the end of the week all developers can:

- Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs

- Run stand-ups and retrospectives
- Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
- Give and receive meaningful code review

## Monday 16th December 2019

- **MakersBnB group project setup**
  
  Components: Me, Sam, Andrew and Tuan.

- **Retro**

  - Sam: 
    I think we got quite a bit done
    We have been courteous
    We weren’t as direct and it cost us some time deliberating; How direct should we be?
    Excited to see
    I learned restful APIs
    
  - Tuan:
    Happy with everything
    We had all the basic features done, everything is set up for unit tests
    We could have maybe drawn more diagrams/planned out better (visually etc.)
    
  - Andrew:
    It was good to get something up and running quickly
    It helped to think more about the user stories; better idea of what’s needed
    Agrees with Andrea that we should have planned more thoroughly, but now we can use it to our advantage
    We should whiteboard site navigation after this retro
    Plan some, write code, reflect - more reviews mean a better gauge of direction towards end-goal
    We should split into pairs early to get things going quicker
    
  - Andrea:
    Feels we underestimated the difficulty of the challenge
    We may have been overcomplicating things too soon
    I’d prefer not to get too far ahead without a firm grasp on the basics
    'I was confused for a portion of the day’ - best to work systematically
    Happy with Active Record
    The amount of work we do isn’t an indicator of how the day went

  - Plan of action (evening):
    Everyone: think of database structure
    Andrea: look at restful routes, maybe ask a coach on specific issues
    Tuan: look at restful routes
    Andrew: Trello
    Sam: Think through rough class diagrams as they work with active record
