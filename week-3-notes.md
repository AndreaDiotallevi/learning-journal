- Build a simple web app
- Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
- Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
- Explain the MVC pattern

## Monday 25th November 2019

- I paired with Ellie today and maybe for the first time I struggled to keep pace with my pair. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the afternoon as we went along really well.

- We learned about HTTP requests & responses, parameters, forms and started setting up a project with Sinatra.

## Tuesday 26th November 2019

- The 3 things every README should include are:

  - Description of what the project is about.

  - Prerequisites and how to use it.

  - How to run the tests.

- Workshop on process modelling, applied to HTTP request/response cycle: we were divided in groups of five to discuss about HTTP GET and POST requests, draw a diagram and explain what headers are and what is the flow of the protocol.

- I paired with Andrew on the web development project and it was interesting as it represented a complete new territory to me. I liked the fact that we went step by step trying to solve the challenges on our own and not rushing through without having understood the concepts.

## Wednesday 27th November 2019

- Attended the "empathy workshop" in the morning and I enjoyed the sharing part at the end where everybody had to share something they liked about the person on the left. I also loved the phrase: "Try to be interested, not interesting".

- I paired with Charlie and it was a funny session. I enjoyed his use of sense of humor towards code challenges. I also helped him understanding things, while I was the navigator, which it was a success for me.
