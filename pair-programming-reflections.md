# Pair Programming Reflections

[**Week 4**](https://github.com/AndreaDiotallevi/makers-portfolio/blob/master/week-4-notes.md) - [Day 23](#day-23-tuesday-3rd-december-2019---eve)

### Day 23, Tuesday 3rd December 2019 - Eve

For the first time I had the chance to take proper notes during the pairing session. We both enjoyed having time to write down the main concepts, without the rush to skim through the challenges. I mostly navigated the session, but I embraced the opportunity to look at things step by step with the help of technical resources. We also communicated effectively and helped each other massively during our driving and researching.
