### Day 22, Monday 2nd December 2019 - Jamie



### Day 23, Tuesday 3rd December 2019 - Eve

For the first time I had the chance to take proper notes during the pairing session. We both enjoyed having time to write down the main concepts, without the rush to skim through the challenges. I mostly navigated the session, but I embraced the opportunity to look at things step by step with the help of technical resources. We also communicated effectively and helped each other massively during our driving and researching.

### Day 24, Wednesday 4th December 2019 - Julie

It was a very pleasant afternoon. We first had a chat about how we had been feeling since the start of the course - with thoughts on trying not to get stressed and be nice to ourselves. We worked on setting up a testing environment with a test database, which was a completely new concept for us. We both liked that we tried to solve the challenge ourselves for a good amount of time before looking at the walkthrough. Although it was a technically challenging session, we had fun working together and I liked Julie's kindness and patience.
