# Pair Programming Reflections

## Tuesday 3rd December - Eve

For the first time I had the chance to take proper notes during the pairing session. We both enjoyed having time to write down the main concepts, without the rush to skim through the challenges. I mostly navigated the session, but I embraced the opportunity to look at things step by step with the help of technical resources. We also communicated effectively and helped each other massively during our driving and reseatching.
