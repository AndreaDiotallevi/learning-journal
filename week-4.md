[Monday](#monday-2nd-december-2019) | [Tuesday](#tuesday-3rd-december-2019)

By the end of the week all developers can:

- Build a simple web app with a database
- Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
- Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships)

## Monday 2nd December 2019

- **Further understanding of user stories**

  ```
  As a time-pressed user <Stakeholder>
  So that I can quickly go to web sites I regularly visit <Motivation>
  I would like to see a list of bookmarks <Task>
  ```

- **Further understanding of domain models**

- **Setting up a database with PostgreSQL**

  It was interesting and the first time we set up and created a database. Next step is getting more comfortable with the common PostgreSQL terminal commands and learn more about what a relational database is.

- **Creating the first table using SQL**

  We spent a lot of time researching the right syntax for creating a new table from the command line. Next step is learning the most important query commands in order to manipulate table data.

- **Pairing with Jamie**

  The pairing session was a lot of fun. We were both very concentrated and laid back, and went on solving the challenges helping each other.
